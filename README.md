MiniWall RESTFul API
MiniWall is a SaaS API where users can post their thoughts, views, or
criticisms for everyone to see while other users can browse and interact
by providing comments and likes.
I will install, test, and document my developments as described
in the coursework brief. My software should support the following:
• Authorise my users to access the MiniWall API using the oAuth
protocol.
• Authorised users can post a text in the MiniWall system.
• Authorised users can browse all posts.
• Authorised users can comment or like a post.
I will use the NodeJS framework to develop my software. I am advised
to use code samples from the lab tutorials and online sources by
providing the appropriate references (in text and code). I am also
encouraged to improvise giving clear descriptions of your functionality
and your implementation decisions.
